# Example 02: Private ACR with AKS and Private Endpoint

In this example, we deploy **AKS** into a private subnet and connect it to a
**private Azure Container Registry (ACR)** using a **Private Endpoint** and
**Private DNS**. The goal is a clean, private image‑pull path without exposing
ACR to the public internet.

This is a focused example that shows:
- how AKS resolves ACR privately via DNS,
- how Private Endpoint traffic stays on the Azure backbone,
- and how to keep ACR reachable only through the private endpoint.

## 🧭 Architecture Overview

This deployment creates:
- An **AKS cluster** via `terraform-az-fk-aks`
- A **Virtual Network** with two subnets via `terraform-az-fk-vnet`
  - `fk-subnet-aks` for AKS nodes
  - `fk-subnet-private-endpoints` for Private Endpoints
- An **Azure Container Registry (ACR)** (Premium SKU)
- A **Private Endpoint** for the ACR `registry` subresource via `terraform-az-fk-private-endpoint`
- A **Private DNS Zone** (`privatelink.azurecr.io`) with a VNet link

## 🔐 Private DNS Flow

Private DNS ensures the standard ACR FQDN resolves to the **private IP** of the endpoint:
